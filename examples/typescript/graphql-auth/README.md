# GraphQL Server with Authentication & Permissions

This example shows how to implement a **GraphQL server with an email-password-based authentication workflow and authentication rules**, based on Prisma, [graphql-yoga](https://github.com/prisma/graphql-yoga), [graphql-shield](https://github.com/maticzav/graphql-shield) & [GraphQL Nexus](https://graphql-nexus.com/).

### 6. Changing the GraphQL schema

To make changes to the GraphQL schema, you need to manipulate the [`Query`](./src/resolvers/Query.ts) and [`Mutation`](./src/resolvers/Mutation.ts) types.

Note that the [`start`](./package.json#L6) script also starts a development server that automatically updates your schema every time you save a file. This way, the auto-generated [GraphQL schema](./src/generated/schema.graphql) updates whenever you make changes in to the `Query` or `Mutation` types inside your TypeScript code.
